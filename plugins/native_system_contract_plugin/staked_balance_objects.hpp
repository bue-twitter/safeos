    * These fields are used for the producer scheduling algorithm which uses a virtual race to ensure that runner-up
    * producers are given proportional time for producing blocks. Producers are constantly running a racetrack of
    * length config::ProducerRaceLapLength, at a speed equal to the number of votes they have received. Runner-up
    * producers, who lack sufficient votes to get in as a top-N voted producer, get scheduled to produce a block every
    * time they finish the race. The race algorithm ensures that runner-up producers are scheduled with a frequency
    * proportional to their relative vote tallies; i.e. a runner-up with more votes is scheduled more often than one
    * with fewer votes, but all runners-up with any votes will theoretically be scheduled eventually.
    *
    * Whenever a runner-up producer needs to be scheduled, the one projected to finish the race next is taken, with the
    * caveat that any producers already scheduled for other reasons (such as being a top-N voted producer) cannot be
    * scheduled a second time in the same round, and thus they are skipped/ignored when looking for the producer
    * projected to finish next. After selecting the runner-up for scheduling, the global current race time is updated
    * to the point at which the winner crossed the finish line (i.e. his position is zero: he is now beginning his next
    * lap). Furthermore, all producers which crossed the finish line ahead of the winner, but were ineligible to win as
    * they were already scheduled in the next round, are effectively held at the finish line until the winner crosses,
    * so their positions are all also set to zero.
    *
    * Every time the number of votes for a given producer changes, the producer's speed in the race changes and thus
    * his projected finishing time changes. In this event, the stats must be updated: first, the producer's position is
    * updated to reflect his progress since the last stats update to the current race time; second, the producer's
    * projected finishing time based on his new position and speed are updated so we know where he shakes out in the
    * new projected finish times.
    *
    * @warning Do not update these values directly; use @ref updateVotes instead!
